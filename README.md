# Digital-Sound-Processing-Project-MIR
 The objective of this project is to practice with tools and methodologies on deriving descriptors of audio signals, and with fundamental machine learning (ML) classification algorithms. 
 Using the FMA Dataset and the scikit and essentia libraries, I made a model that predicts the genre of a song, out of 4 possible ones.
